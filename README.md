## Getting Started with XOS and CORD

For a general introduction to XOS and how it is used in CORD, see
http://guide.xosproject.org. The "Developer Guide" at that URL is
especially helpful, although it is sync'ed with the previous
release (currently Burwell), which likely lags what's in master.
Additional design notes, presentations, and other collateral are 
also available at http://xosproject.org.

The quickest way to get started is to look at the collection of
"stock" configurations in *xos/configurations*. The *cord* 
configuration in that directory corresponds to our current 
CORD development environment, and the README you'll find there
will help you get started.
