This configuration is based on the "devel" configuration for CloudLab.  It is
meant to work with an OpenStack Kilo cluster installed on CloudLab using the
procedure documented here:

https://github.com/andybavier/opencloud-cluster-setup

It launches an XOS container on Cloudlab that runs the XOS develserver. The
container is left running in the background.
